Computer programming, the art of instructing computers to perform tasks, relies on fundamental elements that form the building blocks of code. In C++, one of the most popular programming languages, these basic elements serve as the foundation for creating powerful and efficient software solutions. From variables and data types to control structures and functions, understanding these core concepts is essential for mastering both C++ and computer programming as a whole.

# Sumary

This chapter provides backgroud on the processes and buildig blocks of computers. We cover the basic languages and the techniques that are used within computing. In order to work with computers make sure you understand the difference between input and output devices. Input deals with user interactions such as a keyboard or microphne. Output deal with devices that are used in addition to the program. For example a monitor or speaker. 

Key Terms:
Central Processing Unit- the "brain" of the computer and the most expensive hardare
input device- devices that feed data and programs into computers
output devices- the devices computers use to display results
system programs- controls the computer.
operating sytem- the system program that loads first when you turn on your computer. It also provides services like memory management, input/output activities, and storage management.
application programs- include word processors, spreadsheets, and games
analog signals- continously varying continous wave forms used to represent such things as sounds
digital signals- represent informations with a sequence of 0s and 1s. 
binary digit- the digits 0 and 1 
binary code- the sequnce of 0s and 1s
byte- a sequence of eight bits
kilobyte- 2^10 = 1024
mnemonic- an easy to remember form
object-oriented design- is widely used programming methodology
